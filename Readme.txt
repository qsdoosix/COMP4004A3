For permutation tests, i use following strategy
Straight related hand (Royal flush, Straight flush, Straight)
1 ordered case (i.e. 3,4,5,6,7)
1 reversed ordered case (i.e. 7,6,5,4,3)
1 gapped case (i.e. 3,5,7,4,6)
1 randomized case (i.e. 3,7,5,6,4)
And during these cases the color will be changed to make every position in hand have all 4 colors.

Same card related hand (4 of a kind, 3 of a kind, Full house)
1 case that all same card are at beginning of hand (i.e. 3,3,3,5,8)
1 case that all same card are at end of hand (i.e. 4,6,7,7,7)
1 case that all same card are in middle (i.e. 3,6,6,6,4)
1 case that one different card is inserted in middle (i.e. 6,4,6,6,6)
1 case that both different card (if exist) is inserted in middle (i.e. 6,3,6,3,6)
